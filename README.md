# Execution-Timer
Contains a demo for an execution timer written in C++

This function was originally written to be implemented in a larger project before the function was deemed unnecessary and potentially unsafe as it executes user code.

It takes a string as an input, which must be simple Python. 

It then starts a timer, executes the code, then ends a timer, returning the time between start and end as the execution time.
